title: "Collaborative Online Judge System"
description: "
Implemented a web-based collaborative code editor which supports multiple user editing simultaneously (ACE, Socket.io, Redis).<br>
Designed and developed a single-page web application for coding problems (Angular2, Auth0, Node.js, MongoDB).<br>
Built a user-code executor service which can build and execute user's code (Docker, Flask).<br>
Refactored and improved system throughput by decoupling services using RESTful API and loading balancing by Nginx (REST API, Nginx).<br>
